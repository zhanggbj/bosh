# Running BATs manually

You can run BATs manually against an already deployed director.

## Required Environment Variables

Before you can run BAT, you need to set the following environment variables:

```
# DNS name or IP address of the bosh director used for testing (without the scheme)
export BAT_DIRECTOR=

# Username of bosh director used for testing (optional, only needed if you do not use the defaults)
#export BAT_DIRECTOR_USER=

# User's password of bosh director used for testing (optional, only needed if you do not use the defaults)
#export BAT_DIRECTOR_PASSWORD=

# path to the stemcell you want to use for testing
export BAT_STEMCELL=

# path to the bat yaml file which is used to generate the deployment manifest (see below `bat.yml`)
export BAT_DEPLOYMENT_SPEC=

# password used to ssh to the stemcells
export BAT_VCAP_PASSWORD=

# DNS host or IP where BOSH-controlled PowerDNS server is running, which is required for the DNS tests. For example, if BAT is being run against a MicroBOSH then this value will be the same as BAT_DIRECTOR
export BAT_DNS_HOST=

# the full path to the private key for ssh into the bosh instances
export BOSH_KEY_PATH=

# the name of infrastructure that is used by bosh deployment. Examples: aws, vsphere, openstack, warden.
export BAT_INFRASTRUCTURE=

# the type of networking being used: `dynamic` or `manual`.
export BAT_NETWORKING=

# the path to ssh key, if set bosh ssh will use gateway host and user (optional; required when deployed to vpc)
#export BAT_VCAP_PRIVATE_KEY=

# Run tests with --fail-fast and skip cleanup in case of failure (optional)
#export BAT_DEBUG_MODE=
```

The 'dns' property MUST NOT be specified in the bat deployment spec properties. At all.

## bat.yml

Create bat.yml that is used by BATs to generate manifest. Set `BAT_DEPLOYMENT_SPEC` to point to bat.yml file path.

## EC2 Networking Config

### On EC2 with AWS-provided DHCP networking

Add TCP port `4567` to the **default** security group.

### On EC2 with VPC networking

Create a **bat** security group in the same VPC the BAT_DIRECTOR is running in. Allow inbound access to TCP ports
 `22` and `4567` to the bat security group.

## OpenStack Setup

### Flavors

Create the following flavors:

* `m1.small`
    * ephemeral disk > 6GB
    * root disk big enough for stemcell root partition (currently 3GB)
* `no-ephemeral`
    * ephemeral disk = 0
    * root disk big enough for stemcell root partition (currently 3GB), plus at least 1GB for ephemeral & swap partitions

### Networking Config

Add TCP ports `22` and `4567` to the **default** security group.

## Running BAT

When all of the above is ready, to run the whole test suite, go inside the "bat" directory with `cd <<bosh base dir>>/bat` and run `bundle exec rspec`.
